In the darkness, I'm surrounded by the echoes of the fallen, my comrades who were my family. 
They're gone now, taken by some unfathomable horror that lurks in the shadows, its shape and form a senseless mess i do not understand. 
Somehow, it spared me - or perhaps another force intervened to drive it away. Regardless, I find myself alone, save for the meager supplies clutched tightly in my hands and the dagger at my side. 
My sword, a trusted companion in battle, and a cherished heirloom from my father, was lost amidst the chaos.

The darkness is oppressive, broken only by the faint glow of mushrooms in the distance. 
I strain my eyes to make sense of my surroundings, but the veil of darkness obscures any landmarks. 
Did I flee far from the camp before succumbing to unconsciousness, or am I still within its vicinity?

Navigating my way back to camp is imperative; without those vital supplies, the journey homward becomes an insurmountable challange.
Yet, it's not merely the necessity that drives me; my curiosity, a relentless force, compells me to unravel the mystery of what unfolded here...

..What killed all my men?
..Is there a reason it spared me?
..Was there something else that drove it away? 

Countless queries swarm my mind.. Yet, amidst this sea of uncertainty, I must act decisively to ensure my survival.
