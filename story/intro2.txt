With the makeshift torch in hand, its faint glow struggling against the suffocating darkness, I feel a renewed sense of determination coursing through me.
The memory of my fallen comrades spurs me forward, driving me to uncover the truth behind their demise and the inexplicable events that led to this desolation.

Not far ahead, a semblance of a path materializes, as i approach, familiarity dawns upon me; I recognize this place. We marched through here not long before we set up camp.

I have to pause briefly, to gather my strength and prepare to face the grisly sight that awaits -my friends, all of them dead and ripped to pieces by that twisted demon. 

As I begin to inch closer, an unsettling sensation envelops me, an amalgamation of fear and a peculiar, almost seductive pull. But as quickly as it arrives, it dissipates, leaving me deeply unsettled yet oddly intrigued.
However, I mustn't dwell on this enigmatic feeling. I must remain focused on the task at hand: retrieving any supplies and scouring for clues regarding the tragic events that unfolded.

Approaching the camp, a lingering glow of fire, now reduced to embers, flickers in the distance. 

Amidst the silence of this eternal night, I detect subtle movements, a rustling that hints at unseen activity nearby. Could it be that someone survived?
As I cautiously advance, my heart races with anticipation, bracing for whatever may lie ahead.
